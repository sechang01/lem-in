find minimum distance from start to end.

find fastest x number of paths (no overlapping rooms), x = # of starting points.

if multiple starts:

find lowest common factor? = min bottleneck?

enter - recursion.

if multiple exits:

create linked list to depict model ?

read input, write visiualation
